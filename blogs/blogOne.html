        Hello there, I am Miheer you must be aware about people who
        talk to animals , birds but , have you ever heard about people who Talks
        to Machines , it's ok don't be so startled . Yes you read absolutely
        correct "Machines" . What Machine means to you ? I know everyone have
        already watched 3 Idiots , so now you are going to say "zip of pant is
        machine up-down up-down" yes definitely it is machine like " Everywhere
        I go , I see Machines" . So our point is who are talk to the machines ?
        is he/she who operates machines in factory or one who Assemble that
        machines ? or who which shows first trial of that machine when you buy
        it or saw it. but Truth is no one from all of them . Then who ?
        <br>The one
        who really Talks to machines is Programmers. I know lots of things are
        messing up your mind. What programmers do with machines, maybe they just
        write some words with including symbols in with different colors in dark
        lights and wearing hoodie with Mask up. LOL this is the image of
        Programmer in every ones mind. So How he can really talk with Machines.
        Let's talk about daily life, When you use laptops, computers and now
        smartphones are Everywhere so anything you do on this gadgets is because
        of greate programmers. Like you set up an alarm on the phone to wake up
        early in the morning, You plays games on your phone, plays music on
        phone, checking up whats app messages, Facebook Stories, Instagram DM's
        etc. all that is because programmers. How can you set a alarm in some
        clicks or How can you play games on that small screen. Because there are
        thousands of lines of codes behind your single action. What are this
        lines means to ? How its possible That words ,numbers ,symbols results
        in such a beautiful interface? Questions Again. 
       <br> So these lines are
        called programes written in some programming languages. Ok then what is
        programming language? In the halfway of 90's first computer language was
        invented which was named as "Fortran" after that number of languages
        were formulated maybe much batter than 1st one. So in short in these
        computer language these Alphabates, Numbers and symbols have given their
        respective function. Like addition symbol have Addition function
        Somethimg like that. Point is that programmer is aware of these
        languages. Not from birth! obviously he learnt that languages. Thsese
        languages are made for communicating with smartest machine Known as
        Computer. Yes we programmers do talk to computers with the help of these
        languages. You will be surprised that these talks are similar to Human
        talks like us, maybe much honest and loyal. 
       <br> Computer Don't even recognize
        these alphabats and numbers. You know? Funny thing is computers only
        knows 2 binary characters 0s and 1s. So Compilers or Interpreters
        Converts this code into machine language or in Binary form. This is how
        we talk to machines in their language and they gives us output or
        message in our language. Thats how its done now you may have questions
        like how the numbers and alphabates get converted into that binary
        language? what are compilers?
       <br>  So, all the code(programe) written by
        coder is in human readable format basically in english language with
        some weird syntax(for zero knowledge of programming). how it get
        converted to binary which computer understands is by compilers. which
        are aslo made by programmers. Now why I'm telling you that, because
        having a skill to talk with computers in this era is important. The
        skill has power to change your life and also your career. and also it
        teaches us how to think and yes I am not saying this.
